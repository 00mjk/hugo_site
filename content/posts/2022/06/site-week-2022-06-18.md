**Note**: To avoid spamming social media *every* time I issue a post, I use each entry in this series to list what I've published since the previous "The site this week" post. (Then, I promote **this**.)

Here are my posts from this past week . . .

- <strong class="pokey">2022-06-12</strong> • [**Sorta scoped styling in Hugo**](/posts/2022/06/sorta-scoped-styling-hugo/)\
Interested in more efficient CSS for your site? Hugo doesn't make it easy, but here's a suggested way you might get there.

- <strong class="pokey">2022-06-13</strong> • [**Using iCloud Mail with a custom domain**](/posts/2022/06/using-icloud-mail-custom-domain/)\
It took Apple a while to get it (maybe) right --- but it's "so far, so good" on something announced at last year's WWDC.

- <strong class="pokey">2022-06-15</strong> • [**IE's dead, Jim**](/posts/2022/06/ies-dead-jim/)\
Years after Microsoft told people to stop using Internet Explorer, the hoary browser at last is (mostly) no more.

**Plug**: Want to know whenever I issue a post? **Follow the feed** (choose [RSS](/index.xml) or [JSON](/index.json)).
