The site now is nearly a month into [CTCAJW Mode](/posts/simplify-simplify-maybe-for-real-this-time/), and is a few days away from the two-year anniversary of when I [started using](/posts/2020/06/fathom-analytics-count-on-it/) [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com).

One of those will continue while, because of that, the other did not.

In that order.

Let me make one thing *extremely* clear: I’ve been 100% pleased with Fathom from Day One, and—were the circumstances different from what I’m about to describe—would’ve stayed with it well into the future. I continue to recommend Fathom Analytics for any website which properly respects its visitors’ privacy. The great people behind Fathom really, really have that aspect nailed *and* yet still provide an exceptional product, despite the seeming limitations such concerns might present. You won’t find any finer analytics provider, or team behind such a provider.

So why I am leaving? Well, simply, I’m leaving *analytics*, period.

Here’s the deal. Because I’m issuing posts more often, I no longer announce each one on social media because I don’t want to be spammy. Instead:
- I now tweet/[toot](https://joinmastodon.org) only once a week when I issue another edition of my [recently begun](/posts/2022/05/site-week-2022-05-28/) series, “The site this week,” summarizing the previous few days’ posts.
- Thus, I’m now emphasizing that regular readers should subscribe to my site’s feeds ([RSS](/index.xml) and [JSON](/index.json) are both available), each of which alerts you to each newly added post. More to the point for what I’m explaining herein, each such feed appearance shows pretty much the post’s *entire content*, not just a summary of it. (I did briefly try tracking those with [UTMs, which Fathom supports](https://usefathom.com/docs/start/utms), but the feed-to-site traffic thus indicated was extremely small, confirming my guess that the vast majority of those reading my feeds don’t go further. They get my content, but not actually coming to this site.)

As a result of these two developments, I no longer need the analytics data which Fathom (or any other provider) can provide, so I’ve decided not to renew.

*However* . . .

I **am** retaining a free *affiliation* with Fathom — so, if you’re interested in giving Fathom a try, you can still take advantage of that to give yourself a **10% discount** on your first month (and, yes, give me a commission) by [using this link](https://usefathom.com/ref/ZKHYWX). End of plug.
