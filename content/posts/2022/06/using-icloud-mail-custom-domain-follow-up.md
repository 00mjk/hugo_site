Wins
- Got Big Kahuna addy moved.
- It works fine, so can let FastMail go when sub ends later this year (but plan to keep it live, for now, just in case; [no refund for unused remainder of sub](https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/1500000277342-Canceling-accounts-and-deleting-users)).

Losses
- Found out how slow copy-to-IMAP is on iCloud Mail.
- Learned MailMate is ultra-IMAP-only.

Results
- Keeping only last half year or so on IMAP.
- Keeping all else local on Mac. (Backup necessary.)
- Goodbye, MailMate.
