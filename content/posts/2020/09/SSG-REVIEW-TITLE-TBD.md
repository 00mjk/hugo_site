Intro --- for those thinking about doing own sites and with SSGs

## The ones to avoid

- Next.js and Nuxt.js

- Gatsby and Gridsome

- Zola

## The ones to consider

- Eleventy (if like a *little* tinkering and have no trouble with NPM, JS, etc.)

- Hugo (but get a good theme so you don't have to do much with Go)

## Wrap

Sum-up.
