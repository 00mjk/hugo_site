So consider this a break from my usual tech-y stuff so I can pontificate on another subject near and dear to my choker: the need to make America's two oldest major pro sports leagues admit at last that the wars are over.

I speak, of course, of how Major League Baseball (MLB) and the National Football League (NFL) are *still* laid out based on long-ago feuds and fusses that matter to very few of their modern-day fans.

The NFL's National and American Conferences date from when the NFL merged with the original American Football League (AFL) in 1966 and began playing a one-league schedule four years later. This arrangement had a precedent from the early 1950s, when the NFL absorbed the All-American Football Conference (AAFC)[^AAFC]

[^AAFC]: Survivors of which to this day are the San Francisco 49ers, Baltimore Ravens, and Indianapolis Colts---although, of those three, only the 49ers still haven't changed their names or metro areas. The Ravens were the original Cleveland Browns; while the Colts, before their storied decades in Baltimore, were first the New York Yanks and then the Dallas Texans (*not* to be confused with the AFL team that, after that league's first three years, became the Kansas City Chiefs).

Meanwhile, MLB has been two leagues since 1903, when the 1876-vintage National League (NL) reluctantly began having its champion play the 1900-vintage[^ALWL] American League (AL) champion in the (usually[^WS]) annual World Series.

[^ALWL]: Purists would remind us that the AL was originally the Western League, founded in 1890.

[^WS]: The notable exceptions were 1904, when the New York Giants refused to play because their owner so hated the AL, and 1994, when players went on strike and MLB cancelled the Fall Classic.

Seeing a pattern here? All the fussing and feuding was a *long time ago*. The vast majority of those who fought the NFL-AFL battle are long gone, and *everybody* involved in the NL-AL dustup is history.

So, too, should be the artificiality of which teams play whom. Each organization should be one big league, divided on geographical lines, as are the National Hockey League (NHL) and National Basketball Association (NBA)---each of which, by the way, also went through mergers and absorptions with long-ago competitors, but managed to end up doing things correctly with geographically oriented conferences and divisions.

Thus, I offer this modest proposal for peace in our time for the two sticklers.
