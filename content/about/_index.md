Welcome. As you’ve doubtless gathered by now, yea, verily, here be where I will choose to explain the reason this site exists. Or, to put it another way: what is the purpose of this, the four-jillionth such personal site (call it a “blog,” if you prefer)---and one-jillionth to be powered by a static site generator (SSG)---to reach the Web since at least last Tuesday?

There are several, in fact.

1. __I #amwriting__, as the hashtag goes, and I will have more to say about that in the months to come. That is, of course, if I ever get the work-in-progress (WIP) done.  
	No, in case that raises the somewhat obvious question, I am _not_ doing stuff for [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org)---another thing I'd never heard of until more recently (last year, in its case). I am playing the Long Game---or, at least, that's what I keep telling myself, since I've been writing this thing for over a year now.  
	(And, yeah, I know: why am I puttering around in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with this blog when I should be working on the WIP? Well, one actually needs the other and, again, I'll have more to say about that when the time is right. Since I'm a natural stopping point in the WIP while I re-jigger the plot and characters _yet freakin’ again_, this seemed like a good time to play SSG Boy.)

2. __I can haz opinions? Yez, I can__. (I admit it; I miss the simple days of the early 2000s when I could see [cute stuff about cats and "cheezburgers"](https://icanhas.cheezburger.com) while taking a break on a 1024&times;768 CRT---but, yes, I digress as usual.) Like your average Joe out here, I have plenty of opinions about apps and OSs, certain kinds of workflow in using those things, and so forth. Some may be of use to you. Some may not. They'll be here, and the Great God Google will, yea, verily, direct you here to see them if you're of a mind. You might even want to keep watching this space for more of the same.  
	Am I anybody special? Nope; just a guy who's been using computers for over 30 years and has learned a few things along the way. But I have been told I can make complicated things easier to understand, and I would be trying to do the same here.  
	That said, I re-state and emphasize the word: _opinions_. In some cases, they will be _just_ that. Buck up, folks.

3. __It's a learning experience__. Since the Kewl Kids have gone off and left us non-SSG users in the dust, it behooved me to give this stuff a try. I had already learned a fair amount of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) since I use [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app) and a couple of other Markdown-friendly apps, so that wasn't as much of an _ick_ factor as it would've been, say, a year ago.  
	However, I can't deny that, as one who delighted in hand-coding Web sites[^1] for 16 years until I was forced by Those Who Paid My Salary At The Time to go the CMS route (and a weirdly non-standard CMS at that), I am loving seeing the comeback of sites powered by plain ol' HTML, albeit created in a different way than in Ye Good Olde Days. I chose Hugo for this purpose, but there are [many others](https://staticgen.com). Oh, my, yes.  
	One thing that’s become clear during this aforementioned learning experience is that, while the instructions for Hugo’ing a site from scratch are definitely out there, they aren’t exactly written for ordinary mortals such as I—although, to be fair to the amazing people who’ve made Hugo possible, I’ve seen worse—and a lot of the best explanations are from others like me who’ve had to learn the hard way, by doing, failing, and doing again (and, yeah, failing again before doing yet again). As a result, I’ll try to find some time to put down a “Hugo for Dummies”-level set of instructions that might just help others who, like me, have Come Here From Other Platforms. At the very least, I’ll try to link to the sites where I’ve scraped together the answers to my many “But how do you do _this_ part?” questions.

[^1]:	Yes, I still like to call them _Web sites_ when I can. I also use the [Oxford comma](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/what-is-the-oxford-comma-and-why-do-people-care-so-much-about-it/). I am incorrigible.
