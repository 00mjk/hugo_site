# Welcome.

Eons ago, when [the Web was a new thing](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) and people still capitalized _Web_, consarn it, [ISPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider) tended to provide free file space for people to have [little personal Web sites](https://consumerist.com/2015/03/20/where-did-everyone-from-the-90s-go-when-we-all-got-facebook-and-quit-web-1-0/). Back in those days, one did so with whatever [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) client one could find, what we now know as static [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) files (but not [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/), not yet anyway), and lots and lots of _these_ sounds:

{{< youtubexpar gsNaR6FRuO0 >}}

And, yes, I had one, back on what then was called [GTE.net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTE). In fact, I was a “Charter Subscriber” to that ISP. (Somewhere in my personal stuff that has survived as I’ve transferred it from computer to computer over the years before The Cloud was a thing, I may even still have the files I used to create it. Perhaps, just in case I need a way to embarrass myself more than I generally do inadvertently each day, I might recreate it within this site and show you young ’uns how I rolled back then, Web-wise.)

As that free-file-space thing gradually went away, so, too, did many personal sites.

Over the years, database-driven content management systems ([CMSs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_management_system)) like [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) appeared. They provide click-and-drag ease in building a personal site, but they tend to be [security nightmares unless properly maintained](https://ithemes.com/2017/01/16/wordpress-security-issues/), which many aren’t. They also introduce a great deal of technical overhead.

And then there are creatures like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, which [for all too many people](https://ia.net/topics/take-the-power-back) have become the only Web-based locations for ordinary folks’ thoughts. Of course, [all these platforms want](https://adammclane.com/2013/03/in-social-media-you-are-the-product/) is to grab your information, show you ads, and—particularly in the case of Facebook—contribute to the [dumbing-down of your culture](https://www.salon.com/2017/07/16/how-social-media-is-dumbing-down-our-communication/) and the [political polarization of your society](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585317305208). What’s the harm??!?

(Don’t worry. This site is going to be apolitical by design unless we, you know, are nearing World War III or something along those lines. Maybe even then, since I doubt my little ol’ site is going to stop The Really Big One.)

Anyway, it seemed a lot of the fun had gone out of puttering around on the Web and actually creating content. Then—first among the techno-cognoscenti and, more recently, among us ordinary folks—came Web sites powered by [static site generators (SSGs)](https://www.staticgen.com) and written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). I found them a source of curiosity at first but gradually became more interested in the prospect, especially as I learned more about their [technical advantages](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/reasons-ditch-cms-static-site-generator/).

And, so, here we are.

Like all good sites (and even bad ones), this one will evolve. I hope to make it a place where you can find various little nuggets of info, and occasionally make you laugh a little—even if I hadn’t intended it, but especially if I had.

Again, welcome.
