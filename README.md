# Repo for brycewray.com

This is the repository from which the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)-generated version of [brycewray.com](https://brycewray.com) is generated.

A **starter set** based on this repo’s design and code is in the works. As for this repo, I mainly suggest you use this repo **only for reference**.

## What&rsquo;s under the hood

- Hugo, of course.
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
- [Cloudinary](https://www.cloudinary.com)’s free tier for handling the site’s images, controlling their sizes, and working with my `lazypicture` shortcode to make them [responsive](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/images).
